[V2 (live)](https://confident-pare-b6e027.netlify.app): Django backend rewritten as a lambda function. (limited markov "training" to the user's first 200 tweets for speed)

V1: My first django application, uses twitter api to scrape tweets via username and then uses markov chains to generate new tweets. Built on ReactJs. Hosted on Heroku, taken down because of pricing.
